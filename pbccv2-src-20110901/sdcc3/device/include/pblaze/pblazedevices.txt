#
# Specification of devices supported by the PIC16 target of the
# Small Devices C Compiler (SDCC).
#
# Lines starting with a hash '#' are ignored.
# A new device specification must begin with a 'name' command.
# Numbers can be given in any way acceptable for scanf's %d,
# i.e., octal (0[0-7]*), decimal ([1-9][0-9]*), or hexadecimal
# (0[xX][0-9a-fA-F]+).
# Strings must not be quoted and may not contain whitespace!
#
# Valid commands are:
# name <name>
#       Begin specification of device type <name>, e.g. 18f6720.
#       Aliases 'p<name>' and 'pic<name>' will be recognized as well.
# using <name>
#       Import specification from the named entry, which must be defined
#       earlier. Later commands overrule imported ones.
# ramsize <size>
#       This device has <size> bytes of RAM.
# split <offset>
#       Addresses below <offset> refer to bank 0, addresses above <offset>
#       refer to SFRs in bank 15 for references via the access bank.
# configrange <first> <last>
#       Configuration registers occupy addresses <first> to <last> (both
#       included).
# configword <address> <mask> <value>
#       The config word at address <address> only implements the bits
#       indicated via <mask> (all others will be forced to 0 by the
#       compiler).
#       Unless overridden in C code, use the given default <value>.
# idlocrange <first> <last>
#       ID locations occupy addresses <first> to <last> (both included).
# idword <address> <value>
#       Unless overridden in C code, use the given default <value>.
